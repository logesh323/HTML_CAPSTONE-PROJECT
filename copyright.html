        <h1>COPYRIGHT LAW</h1>
        <P>Copyright law as its name suggests is the simple law that suggests if you create something you own it and only you get to decide what happens next with it.
        The objective of this copyright law is mainly twofold: first to assure authors, composers, artists, designers and other creative people, who risk their capital in putting their works before the public, the right of their original expression, and second to encourage others to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work.</P>
